# Contributing to Codora Timetable

## Golden Rule
If there is no GitHub Issue, do not start work.

## Branching
- Create a new branch for every issue
- Branch name format:
  issue-<issue-number>-short-description

Example:
issue-2-solver-hard-constraints

## Commits
Use clear commit messages:
- feat: add room capacity constraint
- fix: prevent faculty double booking
- chore: add csv templates

## Pull Requests
- One issue per PR
- Mention issue number in PR description
- Do not merge your own PR
